% C++-Tutorial


Pre-Alpha-Warning
-----------------

This tutorial is still a pre-alpha-version.
Do not use it productively and do not point beginners
to it yet. This version is mostly for review.

Patches are very welcome, please refer to the
[github-page](https://github.com/Florianjw/cpp_tutorial)
for that. If you do so, please consider the following aspects:

* This tutorial intends to teach C++ in a top-down way.
  There is no valid reason to show low-level features to
  beginners who will mistake them for something that
  should be used in normal code.
* This tutorial is written using pandoc-markdown. Please
  note that neither standard-markdown, github-markdown nor
  mmd-markdown are fully compatible with that. Therefore
  they are *not* a target.
* If your patch doesn't add much actual content but “only”
  fixes minor bugs (this is heavily welcome and very
  necessary), I ask you to provide it as public domain
  in order to keep the amount of authors who have legal
  control over this tutorial managable. (This might for
  instance be important, should this tutorial get a
  printed version).
* Aside from that all changes must be provided under the
  license of the tutorial (CC-BY-SA).
